## Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program

### Overview

The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program is a Python script that implements the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. This program allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a simple shift-based encryption technique.

### Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:
   ```
   cd caesar-cipher
   ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the Python script `caesar_cipher.py` using Python 3.x:
   ```
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```

4. **Choose Encryption or Decryption**:
   - When prompted, choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message by entering `e` for encryption or `d` for decryption.

5. **Provide Message and Shift Value**:
   - For encryption, enter the plaintext message you wish to encrypt and specify the shift value.
   - For decryption, enter the ciphertext message and provide the same shift value used for encryption.

6. **View Results**:
   - The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message based on your input.

7. **Repeat Operations**:
   - After each encryption or decryption operation, you can choose to perform another operation or exit the program.

### Example

```plaintext
Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? (e/d): e
Enter the message: Hello, World!
Enter the shift value: 3
Encrypted message: Khoor, Zruog!
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): yes

Do you want to encrypt or decrypt? (e/d): d
Enter the message: Khoor, Zruog!
Enter the shift value: 3
Decrypted message: Hello, World!
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): no
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Conclusion

The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Program provides a straightforward way to experiment with the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Whether you're a cryptography enthusiast or a beginner learning about encryption techniques, this program offers a hands-on experience with a classic cryptographic method. Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, and expand its functionality as needed.
